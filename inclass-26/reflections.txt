what did you hope to learn but did not?
	I think web security is quite interesting and want to know more 
	about it, e.g how to defend our website from hacking.

what did you really enjoy learning about?
	Both those basic techniques like html, javascript, and css, and 
	the currting-edge techniques like react and redux. Besides, personally
	I think it is quite useful to have extra resource provided as tutorial
	, like those link for react and redux.

What worked well in the course? and how?
	I do like the color of the lecture slides and those codes listed in the slides
	can better explain the concepts.
	
What did not work well in the course and how might it be improved?
	I think if we can get the slides earlier, we can have more time to read them 
	in advance to keep pace with course.

What could I have done to help you more, presentation of material, design of in class
exercises, goals of projects â€“ and be specific please!
	I think it can help if more resources or links are provided in the slides after those
	key concepts.
